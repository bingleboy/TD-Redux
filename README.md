# Teardown Redux
##### (Aka Teardown: Shitless)
<u>Teardown but without all the awful UI changes saber made.</u>
 
To install: copy the level, script, and ui folders into your Teardown/data folder. If that doesn't make any sense to you, don't bother me!

Features:
* removed all the terrible saber ui (you could delete `components`, `ui_extensions`, `ui_common.lua`, `ui_extensions.lua`, and `ui_helpers.lua` and in theory everything in this would still work)
* Updated the old ui to have all the options added by the new update
* Every single reference to Saber that I could find has been removed
* Added some additional options acessible from the bottom-left corner of the main menu

__This probably has a hell of a lot of bugs, and doesn't entirely support localization or controllers__, but quite frankly at this rate I'd take anything that isn't Saber's bullshit. __Localization and controller support are my next priority after fixing any bugs.__ If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, you can try doing Github shit to report or fix it, but I haven't the slightest clue how these features work because I hardly use Github. You can also just ping me about it in the Teardown discord.
